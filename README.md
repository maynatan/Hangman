# Hangman
### Written in Python

Lets play The Hangman game!


**You need:** 
* Text file with words

**Run the game:**
* file path/python hangman.py


The game chooses a word and you need to guess it. In every round enter a letter that you think is part of the secret word.  

If the guessed letter appears in the secret word, the game reveals the letter in all the positions where it appears. 
If the guessed letter does not appear, the player can try again - but the number of attempts is limited.
